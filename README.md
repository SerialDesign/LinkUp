# LinkUp App

- Frontend folder -> React Native with Expo
- Backend folder -> Express API for creating Link Libraries and adding Links

## Prerequisites

- XCode is needed for iOS Simulator
- You have to use NPM (pnpm does not work!)

## Quick Start

1. Install all dependencies in both folders via `bash ./scripts/install-deps.sh`
2. Run both the backend and the frontend via `bash ./scripts/start-app.sh`
3. **Optional:** Reset all dependencies via `bash ./scripts/reset-deps.sh`
